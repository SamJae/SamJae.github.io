<h2>My Home Court</h2>

If you exit the pearled lobby of The Ludlow and walk a few blocks you’ll hear people calling screens and the squeak of sneakers suddenly coming to a stop on concrete. These are my courts. These are the Sara D. Roosevelt basketball courts. The crisp air flowing in the open area will fill your lungs and the hot sun beaming down on your skin will make you feel truly alive.
This is a place that holds many precious memories of mine. One memory I am deeply fond of connecting to the courts also took place during the summer. Plans were made with three of my closest friends to play basketball. When I first got there, there was a slight drizzle that I believed would just pass through. Two out of three of the boys were there and we decided to get into a pick-up game as we waited for the last. By the time he got here the weather went from a drizzle to pouring rain. Everyone other than me and my friends had left but we still wanted to hoop. At first we weren’t having the best of times and could barely play without hurting ourselves and tripping over the slippery concrete. We eventually embraced the stupidity of it all and started having fun with it. I was draining shots and it felt like I had infinite stamina thanks to the cold rainwater hugging my body. Despite the impracticality of the situation, this is probably one of my favorite moments of basketball in general because of the surrealness of the situation. It felt like those courts were our world to do whatever we wanted in. Unbounded by fatigue, rules, or outsider judgement.
These black tops have taught me many important life lessons, making me who I am today. One day I came to the realization that I wanted to improve my shooting and went out by myself in order to work on my game. I started with the basics, shooting closer to the net and progressively shot further and further from the net as I started polishing my shooting form. I started seeing progress after a few days of doing this and decided to take a break for two days. The next day I played with my friends and noticed that I wasn’t making nearly as many shots as I should’ve been making. That’s when I realized that I needed much more discipline towards working on my game in order to see real progress. So I started going out five times a week making sure I never took a break for longer than one day. My shooting form had never been better and I could confidently say that I was head and shoulders above the rest of my friends in terms of shooting. Although I no longer practice basketball nearly as religiously and I couldn’t have done this unless it was the summer, this experience has taught me that nothing comes easy in life and if you really want something you need to be willing to put in the work. 
Sara D. Roosevelt can be a sanctuary for all New Yorkers regardless of their background. Stopping by when you have time and just joining a pickup game can have many positive effects such as clearing your head and relieving stress. You might need to deal with some disrespect or people arguing over a foul but  these experiences build bonds that lead to a community surrounding the courts and even the neighborhood. There have been multiple occasions where I wave to someone I’ve played with before while walking to the store or going out to grab a bite. I am thankful towards these hoops for giving me invaluable memories, molding me into the person I am today, and providing an oasis for me and the community around me. I am thankful towards these hoops for providing me with these unquantifiable gifts that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.
